## BUILD A MICROSOFT TEAMS CLONE  ( [Microsoft Engage 2021 Challenge](https://microsoft.acehacker.com/engage2021/?mc_cid=a82d11f2ad&mc_eid=89874c26af) )
( Multiple features including ~ :star2: Multiple Participants Video Calling with Realtime Chat + :star2: Adopt Feature implemented using Database)

## <ins>Functionalities</ins>

 :two: ***Screen Sharing***\
 :three: ***Audio mute/unmute***\
 :four: ***Video on/off***\
 :five: ***Whiteboard***\
 :six: ***Start a meeting + Join a chat with URL***
 
 #### :sparkles:Adopt Feature: 
 * Users can create a room before hand and start a conversation before meeting
 * Realtime chat within meeting is stored in the database and available in the room even after meeting is ended.
 * If a room is not created beforehand a new conversation room is created as soon as a new meeting is started and all the chat is stores in it.
 * A video meeting can be started from within the chat whenever needed.

## <ins>Details</ins> 
Your solution should be a fully functional prototype with at least one mandatory functionality - a minimum of two participants should be able connect with each other using your product to have a video conversation.

## <ins>Open-source Credits</ins>
Video Meeting component was open-sourced and re-purposed from [Video Meeting](https://github.com/0x5eba/Video-Meeting).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
